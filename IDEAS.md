Ideas for future modules:

- Polyphonic map/filter/reduce to reduce the number of channels in a polyphonic signal based on a given threshold and/or on/off triggers; map would be send/receive style processing for all channels globally or each channel individually
- Polyphonic merge tool that takes multiple polyphonic cables and combines the channels into less cables, ie:
  | Cable 1 | Cable 2 | Cable 3 | Cable 4 | Output 1           | Output 2             | Output 3  | Output 4 |
  | 4       | 8       | 0       | 0       | 12                 | 0                    | 0         |
  | 16      | 2       | 8       | 6       | 16                 | 16
  | 12      | 16      | 4       | 8       | 16 (1/12,2/4)      | 16 (2/12,3/4)        | 8 (4/8)
  | 16      | 16      | 16      | 4       | 16                 | 16                   | 16       | 16


- Sequencer named after Conlan Nancarrow that does polyrhythmic variations using mathematical constants (ie. 2:pi, 1:e, etc)
- PPN module that takes a clock input and provides common PPN output values ie. 12, 24, 36, 48, etc?
